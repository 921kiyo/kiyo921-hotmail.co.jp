# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

The full report can be found in 'report.pdf'

## Installation guide

All the dependencies are specified in 'requirements.txt'.

The technologies used in the project are following:

- Python 3.6 and Anaconda
- OpenAI gym library for simulation environment
- PyTorch and Numpy for building non-linear function approximation
- Matplotlib for visualising and reporting the experiment
- The hardware used is MacBook 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7 (16GB memory), and no GPU was used to train the agent.

There is no additional dataset to install.

The entry point of the script is "engine.py", and both reinforce and actor-critic algorithm can be found in "reinforce.py" and "actor_critic.py" respectively.
